# glue-d

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FilipMalczak/glue-d.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FilipMalczak/glue-d)

Bunch of different D-lang tools glued together with some sprinkles on top.

The point is to implement autoscanning, implement some annotation system (both done)
then glue together a bunch of other projects: poodinis for DI, its extension for 
better propertiess handling, vibe-d for web, etc. 

Heavily inspired by Spring.
